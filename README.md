This application allows users to keep track of the employees at their company. Using a mySQL server, the user can insert new employees or update the pre-populated employees to their needs. From there, they can see the employee's role, their manager, and the department they work in. Employees can also be updated to different roles within their department, change departments, or have their managers changed. New managers can be added as well. At any point, you can view the employees, roles, and departments as they currently are before deciding to make any changes.
